# Quiz-App
Quiz Application

This Quiz Application works with all browsers. It has only five questions on it. The questions can be easily increased from the Js file.

How it works

1. type in a question number(1-5) where is says 'Question'
2. click on display question to display the question in the selected number. The timer will start immediate
3. when time is up, move your mouse over 'Highlight Answer' to display the correct answer.
4. you can click on 'Numbers left' to view the question numbers that have not been chosen.

P.S  if you enter a number that has been chosen, a pop-up will appear telling you that the number has been chosen you should choose another number.
Also wait for the time to be up before you display another question. 

Clear is used to hide the currently displayed question and numbers left before chosen another question. However, without clearing the next question will automatically override the former.

thanks.
