# Quiz-App
Quiz Application

This Quiz Application works with most browsers. It has only five questions on it. The questions can be easily increased in the main.js file.

How it works

1. Open the Index.html file 
2. Type in a question number(1-5) where is says 'Question'
2. Click on 'Display Question' to display the question contained in the selected number. The timer will start immediately
3. When time is up, move your mouse over 'Highlight Answer' to highlight the correct answer.
4. You can click on 'Numbers left' to view the question numbers that have not been chosen.

P.S  if you enter a number that has been chosen, a pop-up will appear telling you that the number has been chosen you should choose another number.
Also wait for the time to be up before you display another question. 

Clear is used to hide the currently 'Displayed Question and 'Numbers left' before chosing another question. However, without clearing, the next question will automatically override the former.

Thanks.
